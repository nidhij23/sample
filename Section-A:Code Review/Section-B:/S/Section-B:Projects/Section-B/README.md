Code Review for the Java Task:
```
public class recursion {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Saves the string that would be reversed
String myStr = "emosewA si avaJ";
//create Method and pass and input parameter string
String reversed = reverse_string(myStr);
System.out.println("The reversed string is: " + reversed + "\nFibonacci
Series of 10 numbers:0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ");
}
//Method take string parameter and check string is empty or not
public static String reverse_string(String myStr)
{
if (myStr.isEmpty()){
System.out.println("String in now Empty");
return myStr;
}
//Calling Function Recursively
System.out.println("String to be passed in Recursive Function:
"+myStr.substring(1));
return reverseString(myStr.substring(1)) + myStr.charAt(0);}
public static <T> void function(T maxNumber) {
// Set it to the number of elements you want in the Fibonacci Series
int maxNumber = 10;
int previousNumber = 0;
int nextNumber = 1;
System.out.print("Fibonacci Series of "+maxNumber+" numbers:");
for (int i = 1; i <= maxNumber; ++i){
System.out.print(previousNumber+" ");
// On each iteration, we are assigning second number
// to the first number and assigning the sum of last two
// numbers to the second number
int sum = previousNumber + nextNumber;
previousNumber = nextNumber;
nextNumber = sum;
}
}
}

Hi there! Thanks for submitting your code for review. Here is my feedback on your solution:

First, let's start with the "reverse_string" function. The function seems to be attempting to reverse the input string recursively, which is a good start. However, there are a couple of issues with the implementation:

1. Naming conventions: The function name "reverse_string" should follow camel case naming conventions and start with a lower-case letter, such as "reverseString".

2. Recursion termination condition: The function needs to have a termination condition that will stop the recursion when the input string is empty. Otherwise, the recursion will continue indefinitely and cause a stack overflow error.

3.Method call: The method call in your main function is incorrect, you're calling an undefined method name, replace reverse_string with reverseString.

To fix these issues, I suggest the following implementation:

```
public static String reverseString(String myStr) {
    if (myStr.isEmpty()) {
        return myStr;
    }
    return reverseString(myStr.substring(1)) + myStr.charAt(0);
}
```

Now, let's move on to the "function" function that is supposed to print out the first n Fibonacci numbers recursively. Here are my comments on the implementation:

1. Naming conventions: Similar to the "reverse_string" function, the function name "function" should follow camel case naming conventions and start with a lower-case letter, such as "printFibonacciSeries".

2. Input parameter: The input parameter "maxNumber" seems to be declared twice, once as a generic type and again as an integer. It is unnecessary to declare it as a generic type in this case.

3. Method call: You're not using the input parameter of the method function(T maxNumber), replace int maxNumber = 10; with int maxNumber = (Integer)maxNumber; in the printFibonacciSeries method.

To fix these issues, I suggest the following implementation:

```
public static void printFibonacciSeries(int maxNumber) {
    int previousNumber = 0;
    int nextNumber = 1;
    System.out.print("Fibonacci Series of " + maxNumber + " numbers:");
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxNumber; ++i) {
        System.out.print(previousNumber + " ");
        // On each iteration, we are assigning second number
        // to the first number and assigning the sum of last two
        // numbers to the second number
        int sum = previousNumber + nextNumber;
        previousNumber = nextNumber;
        nextNumber = sum;
    }
}
```
Overall, your implementation shows a good start towards solving the given tasks. However, it still needs some modifications to function correctly. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about my feedback.
